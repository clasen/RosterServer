# 👾 RosterServer

**Because hosting multiple HTTPS sites has never been easier!**

Welcome to **RosterServer**, the ultimate domain host router with automatic HTTPS and virtual hosting. Why juggle multiple servers when you can have one server to rule them all? 😉

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic HTTPS** with Let's Encrypt via Greenlock.
- **Dynamic Site Loading**: Just drop your Node.js apps in the `www` folder.
- **Virtual Hosting**: Serve multiple domains from a single server.
- **Automatic Redirects**: Redirect `www` subdomains to the root domain.
- **Zero Configuration**: Well, almost zero. Just a tiny bit of setup.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install roster-server
```

## 🛠️ Usage

### Directory Structure

Your project should look something like this:

```
/srv/
├── greenlock.d/
├── roster/server.js
└── www/
    ├── example.com/
    │   └── index.js
    └── subdomain.example.com/
        └── index.js
```

### Setting Up Your Server

```javascript
// /srv/roster/server.js
const Roster = require('roster-server');

const options = {
    maintainerEmail: 'admin@example.com',
    greenlockConfigDir: '/srv/greenlock.d', // Path to your Greenlock configuration directory
    wwwPath: '/srv/www', // Path to your 'www' directory (default: '../www')
    staging: false // Set to true for Let's Encrypt staging environment
};

const server = new Roster(options);
server.start();
```

### Your Site Handlers

Each domain should have its own folder under `www`, containing an `index.js` that exports a request handler function.

### Examples

I'll help analyze the example files shown. You have 3 different implementations demonstrating various ways to handle requests in RosterServer:

1. **Basic HTTP Handler**:
```javascript:demo/www/example.com/index.js
module.exports = (httpsServer) => {
    return (req, res) => {
        res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain; charset=utf-8' });
        res.end('"Loco de pensar, queriendo entrar en razón, y el corazón tiene razones que la propia razón nunca entenderá."');
    };
};
```

2. **Express App**:
```javascript:demo/www/express.example.com/index.js
const express = require('express');

module.exports = (httpsServer) => {
    const app = express();
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8');
        res.send('"Loco de pensar, queriendo entrar en razón, y el corazón tiene razones que la propia razón nunca entenderá."');
    });

    return app;
}
```

3. **Socket.IO Server**:
```javascript:demo/www/sio.example.com/index.js
const { Server } = require('socket.io');

module.exports = (httpsServer) => {
    const io = new Server(httpsServer);

    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
        console.log('A user connected');

        socket.on('chat:message', (msg) => {
            console.log('Message received:', msg);
            io.emit('chat:message', msg);
        });

        socket.on('disconnect', () => {
            console.log('User disconnected');
        });
    });

    return (req, res) => {
        res.writeHead(200);
        res.end('Socket.IO server running');
    };
};
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# /srv/roster/server.js
node server.js
```

And that's it! Your server is now hosting multiple HTTPS-enabled sites. 🎉

## 🤯 But Wait, There's More!

### Automatic SSL Certificate Management

RosterServer uses [greenlock-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/greenlock-express) to automatically obtain and renew SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt. No need to manually manage certificates ever again. Unless you enjoy that sort of thing. 🧐

### Redirects from `www`

All requests to `www.yourdomain.com` are automatically redirected to `yourdomain.com`. Because who needs the extra three characters? 😏

### Dynamic Site Loading

Add a new site? Just drop it into the `www` folder with an `index.js` file, and RosterServer will handle the rest. No need to restart the server. Well, you might need to restart the server. But that's what `nodemon` is for, right? 😅

## ⚙️ Configuration Options 

When creating a new `RosterServer` instance, you can pass the following options:

- `maintainerEmail` (string): Your email for Let's Encrypt notifications.
- `wwwPath` (string): Path to your `www` directory containing your sites.
- `greenlockConfigDir` (string): Directory for Greenlock configuration.
- `staging` (boolean): Set to `true` to use Let's Encrypt's staging environment (for testing).

## 🧂 A Touch of Magic

You might be thinking, "But setting up HTTPS and virtual hosts is supposed to be complicated and time-consuming!" Well, not anymore. With RosterServer, you can get back to writing code that matters, like defending Earth from alien invaders! 👾👾👾
